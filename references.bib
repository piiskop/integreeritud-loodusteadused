abstract = {Disposal of medical waste (MW) must be considered as a vital need to prevent the spread of pandemics during Coronavirus disease of the pandemic in 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in the globe. In addition, many concerns have been raised due to the significant increase in the generation of MW in recent years. A structured evaluation is required as a framework for the quantifying of potential environmental impacts of the disposal of MW which ultimately leads to the realization of sustainable development goals (SDG). Life cycle assessment (LCA) is considered as a practical approach to examine environmental impacts of any potential processes during all stages of a product's life, including material mining, manufacturing, and delivery. As a result, LCA is known as a suitable method for evaluating environmental impacts for the disposal of MW. In this research, existing scenarios for MW with a unique approach to emergency scenarios for the management of COVID-19 medical waste (CMW) are investigated. In the next step, LCA and its stages are defined comprehensively with the CMW management approach. Moreover, ReCiPe2016 is the most up-to-date method for computing environmental damages in LCA. Then the application of this method for defined scenarios of CMW is examined, and interpretation of results is explained regarding some examples. In the last step, the process of selecting the best environmental-friendly scenario is illustrated by applying weighting analysis. Finally, it can be concluded that LCA can be considered as an effective method to evaluate the environmental burden of CMW management scenarios in present critical conditions of the world to support SDG.}

abstract = {This perspective article explores challenges of traditional education in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) as it relates to emerging sustainable energy and artificial intelligence development. A special perspective is given for education of underrepresented and minority students in STEM. We discuss the existing issues and suggest that, for an equitable sustainable education in the area of energy, artificial intelligence and sustainable society in general, science and technology knowledge should be acquired in conjunction with humanities and arts, through a multidisciplinary STEM+Art (STEAM) approach and special programming that supports inclusion of diverse professional, socio-economical, racial and gender groups. We underscore that infusing technical training with social sciences, arts, ethics, and business prepares future leaders to creatively participate in solving identifiable barriers towards a sustainable society. Whether these are challenges caused by climate change, social tensions, or systematic inequalities, such holistic and sustainable education has the power to ease complex global crises, empower and dignify all people, as well as interrupt environmental degradation.}
